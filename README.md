# Pelgine

Live Version: https://www.pelgine.com

Pelgine allows one to explore the space of pixelartworks through color palettes. Color based search engines typically allow the user to input a single color or multiple pre-selected color, which is limiting because there are many images that are not represented by a single color. Pelgine allows one to search artworks using up to 5 colors of their choice, and gives accurate reccomendations fast.

2. Unzip PJpickle.zip, and place pixeljoint.pickle in the main directory

# To-Do
