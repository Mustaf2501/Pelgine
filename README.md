# Pelgine

Pelgine allows one to explore the space of pixelartworks through color palettes. Color based search engines typically allow the user to input a single color or multiple pre-selected color, which can be limiting. Pelgine allows one to search artworks using up to 5 colors of their choice, and gives accurate reccomendations fast.
